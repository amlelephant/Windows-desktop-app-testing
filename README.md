# Windows App Experiments

A collection of small, work-in-progress projects exploring **Windows application development in C++**.  
These are mostly experimental and unrelated test files, built to get more comfortable with the language and the Windows API.

---

## Purpose
- Practice **C++ programming** in a Windows environment  
- Experiment with **different app functionalities and UI concepts**  
- Build confidence in creating standalone applications  

---

## Notes
These projects are mostly for learning and experimentation.  
Some apps are partially built out, others are just proof-of-concept tests, but together they demonstrate my journey in **hands-on software development**.
